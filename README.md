# Data-Analytics-Portfolio


Hi, I'm Sinthujah. I’m a Public Health graduate with over two years of experience in AI data quality, annotation, and evaluation. I’m transitioning into data analytics, with a focus on health, safety, and AI-driven insights. My work sits at the intersection of data cleaning, public health, and machine learning evaluation, and I enjoy building projects that turn messy real-world data into clear, actionable insights.

I’m currently building a portfolio to showcase my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, dashboards, and SQL. All projects here are created using public datasets or simulated examples. None of my work includes any confidential data from previous employers.

What I’m working on now:
• A data cleaning and exploratory analysis project using a public health dataset
• A health analytics dashboard in Power BI
• A SQL case study using a simulated clinical or public health dataset
• A text-cleaning and model-evaluation mini project inspired by my AI data quality experience

Skills I use:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
SQL
Excel and Google Sheets
Power BI and Tableau
Data cleaning, quality analysis, documentation, and evaluation
Public health data interpretation and reporting

What I'm looking for:
Opportunities to grow into data analytics roles, especially within public health, healthcare, AI, or any mission-driven, data-informed environment. I’m building this portfolio as a self-taught analyst to demonstrate the foundations of analysis, interpretation, and technical workflow design.

Feel free to explore my projects and follow along as I develop new ones.
